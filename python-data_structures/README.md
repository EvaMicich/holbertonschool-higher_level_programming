This directory python-data_structures is a part of holbertonschool-higher_level_programming. It contains python programs which illustrate various data structure concepts. Below are the task summaries:

### Task 0
A python function print_list_integer which prints all integers in a list, one per line. Assumes the list only contains integers and uses str.format() to print integers. File: 0-print_list_integer.py.

### Task 1
A python function element_at which retrieves an element from a list at a given index. Returns None if the index is negative or out of range. File: 1-element_at.py.

### Task 2
A python function replace_in_list which replaces an element of a list at a specific position. If the index is negative or out of range, the original list is returned without modification. File: 2-replace_in_list.py.

### Task 3
A python function print_reversed_list_integer which prints all integers in a list in reverse order, one per line. File: 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py.

### Task 4
A python function new_in_list which replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list. Returns a copy of the original list if the index is negative or out of range. File: 4-new_in_list.py.

### Task 5
A python function no_c which removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string and returns the new string. File: 5-no_c.py.

### Task 6
A python function print_matrix_integer which prints a matrix of integers. File: 6-print_matrix_integer.py.

### Task 7
A python function add_tuple which adds two tuples. File: 7-add_tuple.py.

### Task 8
A python function multiple_returns which returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. File: 8-multiple_returns.py.

### Task 9
A python function max_integer which finds the biggest integer of a list. Returns None if the list is empty. File: 9-max_integer.py.

### Task 10
A python function divisible_by_2 which finds all multiples of 2 in a list and returns a new list with boolean values representing if the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2. File: 10-divisible_by_2.py.

### Task 11
A python function delete_at which deletes the item at a specific position in a list. If the index is negative or out of range, returns the same list. File: 11-delete_at.py.

### Task 12
Python script 12-switch.py which switches the value of a and b. The script is exactly 5 lines long.

To run these scripts, clone the repository and run the scripts using python3.

Note: Some scripts have a main python file which calls these functions for testing purposes. You can run those files to see the output of the functions.
