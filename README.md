# Python - Hello, World

This repository is for beginners in Python Programming Language. It contains exercises that will guide you to learn the fundamental concepts of Python programming.

## Introduction

This repository is intended to guide and challenge new Python learners. Each task requires implementing Python scripts that accomplish certain objectives, helping to familiarize you with the language's syntax, conventions, and capabilities. 

## Concepts Covered
- Python programming
- Python interpreter usage
- Printing text and variables using print
- String manipulation, including indexing and slicing
- Adherence to official Python coding style and pycodestyle checks

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files should be executable and end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- Python Scripts should be maximum of 5 lines long.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

### Task 1: Print integer
Complete the source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

### Task 2: Print float
Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

### Task 3: Print string
Complete the source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

### Task 4: Play with strings
Complete the source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!".

### Task 5: Copy - Cut - Paste
Complete the source code to manipulate and display specific portions of a string.

### Task 6: Create a new sentence
