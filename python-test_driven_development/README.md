# Python - Test-driven development

This repository contains the solutions for the Test-driven development project. It includes multiple Python scripts and corresponding test cases.

## Background Context

Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects:

- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first before you actually code anything.
- The intranet checks for Python projects won't be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD (Test-driven development) and think about all possible cases.
- It is strongly encouraged to work together on test cases to ensure all edge cases are covered, but not in the implementation of them.
- Don't trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an interactive test is
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases
