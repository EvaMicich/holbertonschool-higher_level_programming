# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
This repository contains Python programs that demonstrate the usage of sets, dictionaries, and various related operations. It includes functions for manipulating matrices, searching and replacing elements in a list, adding unique integers, finding common and different elements in sets, counting keys in a dictionary, printing dictionaries with sorted keys, updating dictionaries, deleting keys from dictionaries, multiplying dictionary values, finding the best score in a dictionary, multiplying a list using `map`, and converting Roman numerals to integers.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Sets and their usage
- Common methods of sets and how to use them
- Comparing sets and lists
- Iterating over sets
- Dictionaries and their usage
- Comparing dictionaries, lists, and sets
- Keys in dictionaries and their significance
- Iterating over dictionaries
- Lambda functions
- Map, reduce, and filter functions

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.\*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Quiz Questions
You can find the quiz questions in the repository. The solutions to the questions can be found in the respective Python files.

| `5-number_keys.py` | Returns the number of keys in a dictionary |
| `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py` | Prints a dictionary by ordered keys |
| `7-update_dictionary.py` | Replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary |
| `8-simple_delete.py` | Deletes a key in a dictionary |
| `9-multiply_by_2.py` | Returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2 |
| `10-best_score.py` | Returns a key with the biggest integer value in a dictionary |
| `11-multiply_list_map.py` | Returns a list with all values multiplied by a number using `map` |
| `12-roman_to_int.py` | Converts a Roman numeral to an integer |

## Usage
To run the Python programs, you can use the following command:
```
./filename.py
```
Replace `filename.py` with the name of the Python file you want to execute.
