# Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context

Understanding Object Oriented Programming is crucial for future Python programming tasks. This repository contains various tasks which you will complete to solidify your understanding of classes and objects in Python.

## Task 0: My first square

Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square.

- File: `0-square.py`

### Task 1: Square with size

Write a class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute: size.

- File: `1-square.py`

### Task 2: Size validation

Write a class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute: size. The size must be an integer, if not raise a TypeError exception with the message "size must be an integer".

- File: `2-square.py`

### Task 3: Area of a square

Write a class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute: size. Add a public instance method: `def area(self):` that returns the current square area.

- File: `3-square.py`

### Task 4: Access and update private attribute

Update the class `Square` to define the size with a property and setter.

- File: `4-square.py`

### Task 5: Printing a square

Update the class `Square` to include a public instance method that prints in stdout the square with the character #.

- File: `5-square.py`

### Task 6: Coordinates of a square

Update the class `Square` to include a private instance attribute: position.

- File: `6-square.py`


## More Info

Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Check out the [Google Style Python Docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) example.
