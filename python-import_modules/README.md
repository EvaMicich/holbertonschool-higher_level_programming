# Python Import Modules - Holberton School

This course segment focuses on Python's import system and how to use modules in Python. Students will learn about built-in modules, creating custom modules, and different methods of importing them into their scripts.

## Description

Modules are a way of organizing Python code, and they provide a method of code reuse. They're files containing Python definitions and statements. Python modules have a filename and end with the extension `.py`. This course will explore how to use these modules by importing them into your Python scripts.

## Topics Covered

- Understanding Python modules
- The `import` statement
- Importing modules and module contents
- Using `from...import` statement
- Using `import...as` statement
- Python's built-in modules
- Creating and using custom modules
- The Python Standard Library

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of modules in Python
- Learn to import built-in and custom modules
- Understand the various methods of importing modules
- Learn to create your own Python modules
- Explore Python's standard library

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python
- Installed Python 3.7 or later

## Resources

- [Python Docs - Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
